	abstract = {In this work, we look at the Arduino as a design platform for a course on embedded systems and ask the question, is the Arduino platform suitable for teaching computer engineers and computer scientists an embedded system course with? To examine this question, we describe a project based learning embedded system course that we have taught and identify which topics are covered in it compared to the IEEE/ACM recommendations. The major contention lies in the idea that students can access and use an open source community that is focused on getting things working as opposed to strictly looking at low-level technical aspects of embedded systems. Additionally, the presence of open source and reusable designs makes it difficult to identify what a student is doing. In our experience, using the Arduino exposes students to sufficient complexity and challenges for an embedded system course.},

@article{Hienerth2014,
	abstract = {While many firms today proactively involve users in their new product development efforts using a wide variety of methods such as the lead user method, firm-hosted user communities, or mass customization toolkits, some pioneering firms are experimenting with the creation of sustainable producer–user ecosystems designed for the continuous exploration and exploitation of business opportunities. In this paper, the functioning of such ecosystems is studied with particular emphasis on the synergies they can yield. Based on an explorative and longitudinal multiple case study design, the producer–user ecosystem of the firm LEGO is analyzed, and three main actors in the ecosystem are identified: entrepreneurial lead users who aim to start their own businesses, a vibrant user community, and the LEGO company as the focal producer firm and facilitator for multiple user-to-user and user-to-producer interactions. Our study reveals three kinds of synergies: (1) reduced risk for entrepreneurial lead users and the focal producer firm, (2) the extension of the design space of the focal producer firm's products, and (3) the creation of buzz within the user community. Finally, the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings for innovation researchers and practitioners are discussed.},
